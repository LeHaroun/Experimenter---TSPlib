## Overview

This solution is built based on a robust ACO implementation inspired by the renowned MSDN Magazine article, designed to parse TSPlib problems and manage an extensive array of experiments efficiently. It serves as an essential tool for researchers and practitioners aiming to analyze the performance of ACO on TSP instances with different configurations and parameters.

## Features

- **Powerful ACO Implementation:** Based on the well-known MSDN Magazine article, offering robust performance and reliability.
- **TSPlib Parser:** Enables problem instantiation from standard TSPlib format.
- **Excel Automation:** Incorporates an Excel file for testing automation and the coherent display of results.
- **Extensive Experimentation:** Capable of managing an unlimited number of experiments and ants (agents), allowing in-depth analysis and comparisons.
- **Customizable:** Users can readily modify parameters, number of ants, and problems for each experiment, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.
